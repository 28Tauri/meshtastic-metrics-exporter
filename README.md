# Meshtastic Metrics Exporter

The `meshtastic-metrics-exporter` is a tool designed to export nearly all available data from an MQTT server to a
Prometheus server. It comes with a pre-configured Grafana dashboard connected to both data sources, allowing users to
start creating dashboards immediately.

## Features

- Exports a comprehensive set of metrics from an MQTT server to Prometheus.
- Comes with a Grafana dashboard configured to connect to both Prometheus and Postgres data sources.
  - Comes with some basic dashboards, see the section below for general view of the dashboards
- Stores node details (ID, short/long name, hardware details, and client type) in a Postgres server, which is also part of
  the package.
- Configuration via a `.env` file.

### Grafana Dashboards
The project comes wtih 2 dashboards.
#### Main Dashboard

> The dashboard has some basic data about the mesh network and it's data is temporarely updated (With new data coming in it would fill out the missing pieces automatically)

#### User Panel

> This panel can be reached from the "Node ID" link on the main dashboard (The table in the center) or you can go to it from the dashbaords tab in grafana and select the node you want to spectate. This board includes some telemetry data and basic information about the node.

#### The Node Graph

> Both boards also include node graph which allows you to view nodes which are sending [Neighbour Info packets](https://meshtastic.org/docs/configuration/module/neighbor-info)
> As long as we have some node which is connected to our MQTT server the data would be read buy the exporter and parsed as node graph. The line colors indicate the SNR value and the arrow is the direction of the flow captured (It can be two way). And the node circle color indicates which node is connected to MQTT (Green) which one is disconnected from MQTT (Red) and unknown (Gray - Never connected to the MQTT server)

**I highly recomend giving the system to stabilize over 24 hours before seeking any useful information from it.**

## Exported Metrics

üè∑Ô∏è Common Labels: `node_id, short_name, long_name, hardware_model, role`

Label Notation:
- üè∑Ô∏è: Indicates that all common labels are used.
- üè∑Ô∏è (source): Indicates that all common labels are used, prefixed with "source_" (e.g., source_node_id, source_short_name, etc.).
- üè∑Ô∏è (destination): Indicates that all common labels are used, prefixed with "destination_" (e.g., destination_node_id, destination_short_name, etc.).

The following is a list of metrics exported by the `meshtastic-metrics-exporter`:

## Configuration

The project uses a `.env` file for configuration. Here is an example of the configuration options available:

```dotenv
# Description: Environment variables for the application

# Postgres connection details
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/meshtastic

# Prometheus connection details
PROMETHEUS_COLLECTOR_PORT=9464
PROMETHEUS_JOB=example

# MQTT connection details
MQTT_HOST=
MQTT_PORT=1883
MQTT_USERNAME=
MQTT_PASSWORD=
MQTT_KEEPALIVE=60
MQTT_TOPIC='msh/israel/#'
MQTT_IS_TLS=false

# Exporter configuration
## Hide source data in the exporter (default: false)
MESH_HIDE_SOURCE_DATA=false
## Hide destination data in the exporter (default: false)
MESH_HIDE_DESTINATION_DATA=false
## Filtered ports in the exporter (default: 1, can be a comma-separated list of ports)
FILTERED_PORTS=0
## Hide message content in the TEXT_MESSAGE_APP packets (default: true) (Currently we only log message length, if we hide then all messages would have the same length)
HIDE_MESSAGE=false
## MQTT server Key for decoding messages
MQTT_SERVER_KEY=1PG7OiApB1nwvP+rz05pAQ==

# MQTT protocol version (default: MQTTv5) the public MQTT server supports MQTTv311
# Options: MQTTv311, MQTTv31, MQTTv5
MQTT_PROTOCOL=MQTTv311

# MQTT callback API version (default: VERSION2) the public MQTT server supports VERSION2
# Options: VERSION1, VERSION2
MQTT_CALLBACK_API_VERSION=VERSION2

```

## Running the Project

To run the project, simply use Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will build and start all the necessary services, including the exporter, Prometheus server, Postgres
server, and Grafana.

## Grafana Dashboard

The project includes a Grafana dashboard pre-configured to connect to both the Prometheus and Postgres data sources.
This
allows you to start creating and customizing your dashboards right away.
